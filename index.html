        <h1>Never seen that</h1>
        <p>
            <strong> Yes</strong>, cars do have a culture surrounding it. Without looking into cars, you won't notice
            anything about them. <br>
            You might only see color, size and speed. But trust me when I say that people have spent their lifetime
            building, destroying and adoring cars.
        </p>

        <h2>Why would I care?</h2>
        <p> So you might be wondering: Why whould I care about cars? I only drive to work and back. <br>
            Well, imagine that ride being the most fun of the day where you get to adore the car you're driving. Just
            imagine thinking, searching and building all week and finaly being
            able to show your work of art off on the road. Sounds cool right? Spoiler alert: It is!
        </p>

        <h2>Styles</h2>
        <p>You might not like a car with huge wheels, slammed to the ground and has stickers all over it. Or you
            could be totally into this stuff,
            thats the great part. Its all up to you! There are loads of different types of cars with subtypes in them.
            Trust me, there will always be a car that you adore. <br>
            Just to name a few, there are:</p>
        <div class="v8miata">
            <ul class="autolijst">
                <li>JDM cars</li>
                <li>Muscle cars</li>
                <li>Off-road cars</li>
                <li>daily drivers</li>
                <li>drag cars</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            And if you thought that was all? Absolutely not! there are many more. <br>
            On this page I'd like to go deeper into three of those cars: <strong> JDM cars, Muscle cars and Off-road
                cars.</strong>
            <br>I think you now know more than enough to be interested in cars so lets get deeper into them on the next
            pages.
