        <h1>Aren't muscles in your body?</h1>
        <p>
            Yes ofcourse. But muscle cars are a well known type of car mainly build in America. Some muscle cars you
            might know are:
        </p>
        <ul class="mustang">
            <li>Ford Mustang</li>
            <li>Dodge Challenger</li>
            <li>Dodge Charger</li>
            <li>Chevrolet Camaro</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When is it a muscle car?</h2>

        <p>
            So you now know that there are cars called muscle cars. But when do you call a car a muscle car? <br>
            Down here I will list some characteristics:
        </p>

        <h3>High performance engine</h3>
        <p>
            Muscle cars are well known to come from the factory with a high performance engine. So the car will be
            aggressive from the start.
            For example a v8 engine will have 495-797 horse power. In case you need a reference, a Renault Twingo will
            deliver about 75 horse power.
        </p>

        <h3>Rear wheel drive</h3>

        <p>
            Although it is definitely possible to swap a muscle car to all wheel drive or front wheel drive. Out of the
            factory they will usually have
            rear wheel drive which means all the power will be delivered through the rear wheels. Although rear wheel
            drive is a lot of fun, it can also be
            dangerous since the back of the car will step out and lose grip. So you should be very carefull with all
            this horsepower in the rear wheels.
        </p>

        <h3>Affordability</h3>

        <p>
            To start of affordable doesn't mean cheap. Muscle cars will be expensive no matter what.
            For example a second hand Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 will cost at least around €40.000. <br>
            And yes this isn't cheap but this beast of a car will look amazing, have a big aftermarket support for parts
            and will have over 700 horsepower. A car with a simmilar engine would be The Lamborghini Huracán Evo.
            <b>Yes,</b> this ford mustang is competing with Lamborghini! this model Lamborghini will cost about €330.000
            second hand.
            So in comparison this car is quite affordable.
